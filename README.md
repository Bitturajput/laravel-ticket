Default laravel-ticket front route: http://your-project-url/tickets

Default laravel-ticket admin route: http://your-project-url/tickets-admin

**Notes:**

Make sure you have created at least one status, one priority, and one category before you start creating tickets.

If you move your installation folder to another path (or server), you need to update the row with slug='routes' in table `laravelticketsettings`. After that, don't forget to flush the entire cache.

## Integrating Laravel Ticket views with your project template

### Configuring the master view
Laravel Ticket views system is developed to integrate with the current project master view (Laravel Ticket uses Bootstrap framework). The master view file is the main view file that is using "yield" to call header, content, footer sections. It should be located at resources/views (ex. `resources/views/layouts/master.blade.php`), open it and make sure it yields for page, content, and footer.

@yield('page') Page section for passing the current page title
```html
<head> ...
<title>My website - @yield('page')</title>
</head>
```

@yield('content') Content section for the content
```html
<body> ...
@yield('content')
...
</body>
```

@yield('footer') Footer section for passing the jquery scripts, so make sure it is called after you call the jquery
```html
<body> ...
@yield('content')
...
<script src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
..
@yield('footer')
</body>
```

Here's a [quick example](https://github.com/binshops/laravel-ticket/tree/master/src/Views/sample-app.blade.php) of a layout file.
